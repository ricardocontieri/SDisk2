Instructions for SDISK (OLED version) firmware update

1. First, install the AVRDUDE

	for Windows
		
		download the program from http://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/avrdude
		  
		and install it
		
	for MacOSX do
		  
		ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)" < /dev/null 2> /dev/null
	
		brew install avrdude
		  
	for Linux
		
		  check your distribution package manager software	
		
2. Install the Pandora LAB CH340 driver (only WINDOWS or MacOSX). Not needed for linux if
   you are using a recent kernel

	https://pandoralab.com.br/arduino/driver-ch340-para-arduino/

	OBS: In the case os Mac OS X Sierra the driver provided by Pandora Lab crashes the kernel. There is an updated
	driver with explanation at 

	http://www.mblock.cc/docs/run-makeblock-ch340-ch341-on-mac-os-sierra/
		
3. Upload the firmware using the command

	OBS: You need to remove the SD card from the slot in order to establish the proper connection from the computer to the SDISK ][

    	avrdude -C[config] -v -patmega328p -carduino -P[PORT] -b115200 -D -Uflash:w:[FIRMWARE]:i 

	OBS: In some cases you need to leave a blank space between the flag and argument, for example
			-patmega328p â€”> -p atmega328p
    	
    	
	the arguments are:
    	
    		[config] is the avrdude config file (see avrdude.conf in this repository)
    	
    			for example, .\avrdude.conf
    	
    		[PORT] is the serial port attached to the SDISK II
    			
    			for example, in Windows, this could be PORT7
 			in my case, since I use MacOSX, I got /dev/cu.wchusbserial1420
    			
    		[FIRMWARE] is the path to the firmware file
    	
    			for example, .\firmware\src\sdisk2_oled.hex 

	A full example of the command line, in my computer, using MacOSX Sierra, is

		avrdude -C ../avrdude.conf  -v -p atmega328p -c arduino -P /dev/cu.wchusbserial1420 -b 115200 -D -U flash:w:sdisk2_oled.hex:i
